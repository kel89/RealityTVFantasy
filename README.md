# Reality TV Hosted
This project is a more robust flask application for the Reality
TV fantasy league.

## Layout
There are, at the moment, three main components:

- auth (login)
	- this handles the landing page, signing users up, logging in
- admin
	- this handles league creating and management
- league
	- this is where league standings, teams, charts, etc. live
